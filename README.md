# Moodle Submission Backup 

This Moodle plugin is for a block that list of all a student's assignment submissions in one place. It is titled 
"My Submissions". The listing is broken up by course. Each item listed is named after the activity. The actual file 
download from the link is the same as the original file. The idea is to provide a single place for students to 
download their work; opposed to going through every course they've every taken and trying to find the download link. 
This makes it easier for a student to backup all their assignments. It especially helpful for third party teach 
out agreements.
