# Moodle Submission Backup 

A Moodle block plugin that list a student's assignment submissions for all courses in one place. The idea is
to provide a single place for students to download their work; opposed to going through every course they've every
taken and trying to find the download link. This makes it easier for a student to find and backup all their 
assignments. 

It especially helpful for third party teach out agreements. With Moodle the block displays the title 
"My Submissions". The listing is broken up into section by course. Each item listed is named after the activity.
The actual file downloaded from the link is the same as the original file.
